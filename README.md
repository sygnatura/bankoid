# Bankoid

**Provided for educational purposes. The program worked with an old version of the mBank website. It is currently not functioning.**

**Archival description**

The program enables easy and convenient access to your account. The application connects directly to the bank using a secure, encrypted connection. HTML data from the mBank website is parsed and displayed in the program. You log in with the same username and password that you use in mBank. No user data is intercepted and sent without your knowledge.

The program allows you to: download transaction history; make one-time transfers; top up mobile phones; check your account balance; make transfers to defined recipients; paste a password from an SMS (disabled by default). The last two options are enabled after disabling ads.

"Bankoid" is not a product of mBank/BRE Bank.
